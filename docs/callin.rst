Radio Call In
=============

In this workshop we'll be designing a radio call in application using Twilio's
<Queue> functionality. While we'll be using a radio show as our target, this
style of queue managment can be used for any phone number where many people may
call at the same time.

Prerequisties
-------------

The next sections assume a working knowledge of Twilio. You should be familiar
with TwiML, configuring Twilio phone numbers, and Twilio application model.

Also, we're assuming you're comfortable writing web applications. For
reference, we'll be developing the application along the way using Python
and Google App Engine.

Using the Twilio Helper Libraries
---------------------------------

Though this workshop will assume use of Python and the twilio-python helper
library, Twilio offers helper libraries for a large set of languages. If you
aren't using Python, download the `helper library`_ for your language of
choice. You'll need the library in the next section.

For the twilio-python helper library, you may find the `Queue API
Reference`_ helpful for this workshop.

Using <Queue>
-------------

We'll need two Twilio phone numbers to work with Queue - one for the DJ to
dequeue calls from, and one for the listener to call into.

First, we'll enqueue calls via TwiML. In the example below, we enqueue calls
into a queue named ``radio-callin-queue``. Note that queues are created on
<Enqueue> if they do not already exist.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
        <Say>You are being enqueued now.</Say>
        <Enqueue>radio-callin-queue</Enqueue>
    </Response>

Bind this TwiML to your listener queue number.

We can spice it up by adding some wait music, using the ``waitUrl`` parameter.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
        <Enqueue waitUrl="/wait-loop">radio-callin-queue</Enqueue>
    </Response>

Twilio will request the ``/wait-loop`` and process the TwiML that plays music.
The ``waitUrl`` TwiML document only supports a `subset of TwiML verbs`_, which
includes ``<Say>`` and ``<Play>``.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
        <Say>Please hold.</Say>
        <Play>http://com.twilio.sounds.music.s3.amazonaws.com/MARKOVICHAMP-Borghestral.mp3</Play>
    </Response>


For the DJ dequeuing number, we use TwiML that bridges the current call to the
queue. Note that <Dial>ing into a queue dequeues the front on the queue, while
the only way to get onto a queue is by using the <Enqueue> verb.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
        <Dial>
            <Queue>radio-callin-queue</Queue>
        </Dial>
    </Response>

Now, the DJ can call the DJ dequeuing number, and will automatically be routed
to the first member on the queue.

Dynamic Queue Information
-------------------------

Twilio's Queue exposes dynamic inforrmation about the queue state that
you can use to build rich applications. In this section, we'll move past
static TwiML applications and start using the data Queue gives you to
create dynamic TwiML through a web application.

We'll start by working on our hold music. Wouldn't it be cool if we could tell
users where they were in the queue, how long they've been there, or even the
average wait time for their queue? Twilio sends these parameters via POST data
when invoking your application's waiting logic via HTTP.

================ ===========
Parameter 	 Description
================ ===========
QueuePosition 	 The current queue position for the enqueued call.
QueueSid 	 The SID of the Queue that the caller is in.
QueueTime 	 The time in seconds that the caller has been in the queue.
AverageQueueTime An average of how long time the current enqueued callers has been in the queue.
CurrentQueueSize The current number of enqueued calls in this queue.
================ ===========

Utilizing this information, we can inform our users what position they are in
the queue and how long they can expect to wait before an answer.

.. code-block:: python

    class WaitLoop(webapp2.RequestHandler):
        def post(self):
            response = twiml.Response()
            response.say("You are number %s in line." % self.request.get('QueuePosition'))
            response.say("You've been in line for %s seconds." % self.request.get('QueueTime'))
            response.say("The average wait time is currently %s seconds." % self.request.get('AverageQueueTime'))
            response.play("http://com.twilio.music.rock.s3.amazonaws.com/nickleus_-_original_guitar_song_200907251723.mp3")
            self.response.out.write(str(response))

You can also take advantage of similar information when a call is dequeued
through the ``action`` parameter when enqueuing.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
        <Say>You are being enqueued now.</Say>
        <Enqueue action="/dequeue-logic">radio-callin-queue</Enqueue>
    </Response>

.. code-block:: python

    class DequeueLogic(webapp2.RequestHandler):
        def post(self):
            res = self.request.get('QueueResult')
            if res == 'bridged':
                # save to db, ping analytics, whatever you want!


Handling Long Queue Times
-------------------------

We can use the ``action`` parameter to collect all sorts of useful metrics
on the backend, or even issue hasty apologies for long queue wait times.

Let's try to implement some small features on our dequeue action call to
let our users know we care. Using the `action URL parameters`_, we can
send an SMS apology if the wait time exceeded 30 seconds, or if their
call was rejected from a full queue.

Here is some stub code that may help, if you are taking the Python / Google
App Engine route.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
        <Say>You are being enqueued now.</Say>
        <Enqueue action="/dequeue-logic">radio-callin-queue</Enqueue>
    </Response>

.. code-block:: python

    import webapp2
    class DequeueLogic(webapp2.RequestHandler):
        def post(self):
            
            # ... FILL ME IN ...
            # res = self.request.get('QueueResult')

    app = webapp2.WSGIApplication([('/dequeue-logic', DequeueLogic)], debug=True)

Closing Out the Queue
---------------------

Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. It's time for our radio
show to close down until next time - but what about the people still on the
waiting queue?

We can use `Queue`_ and `Member`_ REST API resources to programmatically look
at all of our account's queues and active members on those queues.

Let's write a quick script that will find our queue, loop through its members,
and dequeue each of them with a thank you message. 

.. code-block:: python

    from twilio.rest import TwilioRestClient
    client = TwilioRestClient("ACCOUNT_SID", "AUTH_TOKEN")
    my_queue_name = "radio-callin-queue"

First, we need to `find our queue`_.

.. code-block:: python

    my_queue = None
    for queue in client.queues.list():
        if queue.friendly_name == my_queue_name:
            my_queue = queue


Then, we can iterate over its members and dequeue with some static thank you
TwiML. Try it yourself! Hint: issuing `an HTTP POST to a Member instance`_ will
dequeue that member.
    
As a bonus, try allowing the callers being dequeued to record a message for the
DJs to listen to at the beginning of the next show.

Finally, we can delete the queue using a REST API call.

.. code-block:: python

    my_queue.delete()
