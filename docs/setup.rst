Initial Setup
=============

Before we start the workshop, we're going to need to make sure we have a few
things. This guide assumes you have nothing currently set up on your computer.
Feel free to skip any sections you've already completed.

This guide will also setup your computer to build web applications using Google
App Engine. If you're planning on using a different development stack during
the workshop, please make sure you can easily deploy new code to it during the
day.

Create a Twilio Account
-----------------------

First, `sign up`_ for a free Twilio account. You won't need a credit card, but
you will need a phone number to prove you aren't a robot. Once you've signed
up, you'll have your own Twilio phone number. We'll use this number for the
rest of the workshop.

**Make sure to use the promo code you were provided for the workshop.**

.. _sign up: https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio

After you've created your account and verified your phone number, you should
end up at a screen that looks like this.

This is your first chance to test out what Twilio can do. Send yourself a text
message and receive a call. Congratulations, you've used Twilio for the first
time!

Download Workshop Materials
---------------------------

Download and unzip the `workshop materials
<https://github.com/twilio/workshop/zipball/master>`_. If you are familiar with
``git``, you can also fork this repository `on Github
<https://github.com/twilio/workshop>`_.

Install a Text Editor
---------------------

Now that you've signed, up, we need to make sure you can edit the workshop
code. **If you already have a text-editor or IDE of choice, skip this section**.

- Windows - Download and install `Notepad++`_
- OS X - Download and install `Text Wrangler`_
- Linux - Install gedit via your package manager
- Any Platform - Download and install `Sublime Text`_ functional demo

.. _Text Wrangler: http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/
.. _Notepad++: http://notepad-plus-plus.org/
.. _Sublime Text: http://www.sublimetext.com/

Install Python
--------------

Open up Terminal, or a command prompt window. and type the following command. If
you aren't sure how to launch your command prompt, ask a TA or a neighbor for
help.

.. code-block:: bash

   python --version

If the output contains ``Python 2.7.x``, your Python installation is ready to
go. If not, download the installer for your operating system:

- `Python 2.7.3 Windows Installer <http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi>`_
- `Python 2.7.3 Windows X86-64 Installer <http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.amd64.msi>`_
- `Python 2.7.3 OS X Installer <http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3-macosx10.6.dmg>`_
- `Python 2.7.3 compressed source tarball <http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/Python-2.7.3.tgz>`_

More downloads are available on the `Python downloads
<http://www.python.org/download/>`_ page.

Once you are finished, opening up Terminal (OS X) or Powershell (Windows) and
verify the output is now the same

.. code-block:: bash

   python --version
   Python 2.7.3

Install the App Engine SDK
--------------------------

We'll be deploying our Twilio applications to **Google App Engine** during the
workshop. **Google App Engine** provides an easy and free way to host your code.
Download and install the SDK for your operating system below.

- `App Engine SDK Windows Installer <http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/GoogleAppEngine-1.7.2.msi>`_
- `App Engine SDK OS X Installer <http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/GoogleAppEngineLauncher-1.7.2.dmg>`_
- `App Engine SDK Linux/Other Platforms <http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/google_appengine_1.7.2.zip>`_

Basic Application Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The workshop directory you downloaded earlier contains a basic web application
that we'll be extending during the workshop. We'll use this location to perform
local testing, and the code we edit here we'll later deploy to **Google App
Engine**. To do this, we need to tell the **Google App Engine Launcher** where
to find our files.

Open the **Google App Engine Launcher**, and from the file menu select "Add
Existing Applicationâ€¦". In the next dialog, click the "Browse" button and locate
the workshop folder. 

.. image:: _static/addapp.png

Click "Add" to finish setting up the application.

Run the Web Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run your application, select your application from the list and click the 
"Run" button. Your app is now running and ready to use.

.. image:: _static/startapp.png

To use your application, click the "Browse" button. Your app will launch in a
browser window.

.. image:: _static/browseapp.png

Your browser will open and you'll see "Hello World!" on screen. Let's take a
moment and look at the URL that is loaded in your browser. The URL says
``http://localhost:8080/``. `localhost` is a special URL that tells the browser
to make a request to your local computer instead of out to the internet. The
``:8080`` portion tells the browser to make the request to port 8080. This URL
is not visible from the internet and, in general, is only visible to you.

.. note::
	
        While ``localhost`` URLs will always address a user's local computer,
        its not entirely private. The application will also respond to your
        computer's IP address, so when developing applications be aware of your
        surroundings and of who else can possibly run your application on the
        network that you are connected to.

In your text editor, let's open up the file ``main.py`` at the root level of the
workshop directory. Change the word ``"World"`` on line 6 to your name and save the
file. Return to the web browser and refresh the window to see your change.

Great! We've successfully run and modified a small Python application running on your computer.

Debugging your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quite often while developing applications, you will encounter errors in your
code. The **Google App Engine Launcher** helps you deal with these errors by
exposing helpful log information when running the local development
environment.

Open the **Google App Engine Launcher**. Select your application from the list
and click the "Logs" button. This will launch a console that outputs activity
from your local development environment.

.. image:: _static/logsapp.png

Your application's access and error logging information will show up in this
window as you access your application.

Deploy your Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's now time to share your application with the world. To deploy your application on
App Engine, you'll need to create an application via your App Engine dashboard 
(which requires a Google account).

Open the `App Engine dashboard  <http://appengine.google.com>`_ in a new tab and
click "Create Application".

.. image:: _static/appenginedashboard.png
	:class: screenshot

You'll need to pick a name and title for your application. Names in **Google App
Engine** need to be lowercase and unique so I'd suggest a workshop specific name
like ``{lastname}-twilio-workshop``.

.. image:: _static/createapp.png
	:class: screenshot

Accept the terms and conditions and click "Create Application"

You'll need to update your local configuration with your new application name.
Open the **Google App Engine Launcher** and highlight your application. Click
the "Edit" button. 

.. image:: _static/editapp.png

There are a few configuration directives in this file but at
this time we only need to be concerned with the Application Name. Replace the
``ahoy-twilio-workshop`` portion of ``application: ahoy-twilio-workshop`` with
the application name you registered and save the file.

.. literalinclude:: ../app.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 1

Open the **Google App Engine Launcher**, highlight your application if it is not
already highlighted, and then click the "Deploy" button. The Launcher app will
upload your code and deploy it.

.. image:: _static/deployapp.png

You'll be asked to sign in with your Google account.

.. note::

   If you use `2-Step Verification
   <http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=180744>`_,
   you'll need to create an application-specific password to authorize your
   account. You generate these on the `Authorizing applications & sites page
   <https://www.google.com/accounts/IssuedAuthSubTokens>`_.

The Launcher app will also output progress information in to the Log:

.. code-block:: text
