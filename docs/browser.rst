Into the Browser
================

Using Twilio Client
-------------------

Using Twilio Client, we can be hooked into the full power of the Twilio API
from your Web Browser. This includes the ability to make and receive phone
calls, opening up the world of telephony to your dynamic web applications.

Let's try writing a web app that is capable of answering phone calls in a
Twilio <Queue>. This way, our Radio DJ won't be required to use their personal
phone when answering queues.

How Client Works
-----------------

This is what an outbound Client call looks like:

1. Your server creates a Capability Token with the Application Sid you would
   like to use to handle outbound calls. 
2. User triggers a `connect()` action in the `twilio.js` Javascript library.
3. Twilio looks up the Application Sid for the Client, and retrieves the Voice
   URL for that application.
4. Twilio makes an HTTP request to the Voice URL and plays the TwiML it
   retrieves back to the user's browser.

To connect an inbound call to your Client browser, generate a Capability Token
that allows incoming connections. Then return this TwiML in response to an
inbound call:

.. code-block:: xml

    <Response>
        <Dial>
            <Client>client-name</Client>
        </Dial>
    </Response>

Creating an Application
-----------------------

We are going to reuse the application we created in the previous example. Set
the Voice Request URL to a new endpoint for the TwiML we want to be executed
when the DJ's browser connects (this should be the same URL as the DJ's dial-in
number).

Generating a Token
------------------

Since Twilio Client applications are being run on the browser, we need to grant
the end user temporary privileges on our Twilio Account. This is the job of
`Capability Tokens <https://www.twilio.com/docs/client/capability-tokens>`_.
Capability Tokens allow us to lock down access to what we want the end user's
session to be able to do. For our needs we only need to add access to making an
outgoing connection to our new Application.

Here is the function we'll use for generating the Capability Token.

.. code-block:: python

    from twilio.util import TwilioCapability

    def generate_token(account_sid, auth_token, application_sid):
        capability = TwilioCapability(account_sid, auth_token)
        # Allow access to the Call-in ApplicationSid we created
        capability.allow_client_outgoing(application_sid)
        return capability.generate()


Answering Queues in the Browser
-------------------------------

The first thing we'll need to build is a web interface. Let's start by adding a
new AppEngine RequestHandler into ``main.py``. 

We have included some helper functions
for generating `Capability Tokens <https://www.twilio.com/docs/client/capability-tokens>`_ and 
rendering templates on AppEngine. Those are imported from ``util.py``.

.. code-block:: python

    from util import gen_token, render_template

    class IndexPage(webapp2.RequestHandler):

        def get(self):
            params = {
                "token": generate_token(ACCOUNT_SID, AUTH_TOKEN, APP_SID)
            }
            self.response.out.write(util.render_template("index.html", params))


Here is the ``index.html`` file we are rendering.

.. code-block:: html

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	  <head>
		<title>Hello Client Monkey 4</title>
		<script type="text/javascript"
		  src="http://static.twilio.com/libs/twiliojs/1.0/twilio.min.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript"
		  src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js">
		</script>
		<link href="http://static0.twilio.com/packages/quickstart/client.css"
		  type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
		<script type="text/javascript">

		  // Render the token we generated on the server side. 
		  Twilio.Device.setup("{{ token }}");

		  Twilio.Device.ready(function (device) {
			$("#log").text("Ready");
		  });

		  Twilio.Device.error(function (error) {
			$("#log").text("Error: " + error.message);
		  });

		  Twilio.Device.connect(function (conn) {
			$("#log").text("Successfully established call");
		  });

		  Twilio.Device.disconnect(function (conn) {
			$("#log").text("Call ended");
		  });

		  Twilio.Device.incoming(function (conn) {
			$("#log").text("Incoming connection from " + conn.parameters.From);
			// accept the incoming connection and start two-way audio
			conn.accept();
		  });

		  function call() {
			// get the phone number to connect the call to
			params = {"PhoneNumber": $("#number").val()};
			Twilio.Device.connect(params);
		  }

		  function hangup() {
			Twilio.Device.disconnectAll();
		  }
		</script>
	  </head>
	  <body>
		<button class="call" onclick="call();">
		  Call
		</button>

		<button class="hangup" onclick="hangup();">
		  Hangup
		</button>

		<input type="text" id="number" name="number"
		  placeholder="Enter a phone number to call"/>

		<div id="log">Loading pigeons...</div>
	  </body>
	</html>

There are two important lines in the Javascript that make this work:

.. code-block:: javascript

    Twilio.Device.setup("{{ token }}");

The above line of code calls ``Twilio.Device.setup`` and uses our templating
engine to pass in a valid Capability Token. When ``setup`` finishes, the
function passed into ``Twilio.Device.ready`` will fire to let the browser know
that Twilio has initialized access to the microphone, speakers, and we've
started listening for incoming calls (if applicable).

.. code-block:: javascript

    function call() {
      Twilio.Device.connect();
    }

This code defines a new function called ``call`` that just wraps
``Twilio.Device.connect``, which initiates an outgoing call to the Application
we created earlier. In this case, calling ``call()`` should execute the TwiML
below. We've made a small change so that the DJ can press "#" to end the
current call, and dial the next person in the queue.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <Response>
        <Dial hangupOnStar="true">
            <Queue>radio-callin-queue</Queue>
        </Dial>
        <Redirect method="GET"></Redirect>
    </Response>

Change your application's Voice URL so it serves this TwiML when dialed.

Getting the Next Caller From the <Queue>
-----------------------------------------

We want to make it easy to hangup the current call and move to the next one by
pressing the "*" key on the phone. Twilio Client has a feature for sending DTMF
tones (the tone when you press "*" on your phone) programmatically.

First, we need to hold on to the response of ``Twilio.Device.connect()`` so
let's add a global variable called ``connection`` and have every ``call()``
command set it. Replace the existing ``call`` function with something like
this:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var connection = null;
    function call() {
        connection = Twilio.Device.connect();
    }

Now, we can add a new function, called ``next()``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    function next() {
        if (connection) {
            connection.sendDigits("*");
        }
    }

Because we added a `hangupOnStar` attribute to our TwiML, sending a "*" symbol
via DTMF tone will hang up on the current caller, and connect the browser to
the next caller.

Now we just need to add another button to trigger the hangup.

.. code-block:: html

    <button class="hangup" onclick="next();">
        Next Caller
    </button>

Adding UI To Display the Queue
------------------------------

Let's add a feature where we can see a visualization of the queue. We'll add
a new queue status endpoint, which will return the current queue status as
JSON.

.. code-block:: python

    import json
    from twilio import TwilioRestClient

    class QueueStatusPage(webapp2.RequestHandler):

        def get(self):
            client = TwilioRestClient(ACCOUNT_SID, AUTH_TOKEN)

            queue = [x for x in client.queues.list() if x.friendly_name == 'radio-callin-queue']

            if queue:
                q_data = {
                    "current_size": queue[0].current_size,
                    'average_wait_time': queue[0].average_wait_time,
                }
                self.response.out.write(json.dumps(q_data))
            else:
                self.abort(404)


Add this QueueStatusPage into the WSGIApplication's routing map as
``/queue-status``. Now we need some HTML for the status, and Javascript to poll
the state of the queue and update the UI.

Add this HTML:

.. code-block:: html

  <div style="width: 500px; font-family: sans-serif; text-align: left; margin: 0 auto;">
    <h2>Queue Status</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Current size: <span id="current-size">0</span>
      <li>Average wait time: <span id="average-wait-time">0</span>
    </ul>
    <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="getQueueStatistics();">Refresh</a>
  </div>

And this Javascript function to fetch the latest queue status and insert it
into the page.

.. code-block:: javascript

    var getQueueStatistics = function() {
      $.getJSON("/queue-status", function(result) {
        $("#current-size").text(result.current_size);
        $("#average-wait-time").text(result.average_wait_time);
      });
    };

    // run the queue fetcher once on page load
    $(function() {
      getQueueStatistics();
    });

Advanced Features
------------------

That is the end of the content for this tutorial. If you still have some time,
try implementing some of these advanced features:

- Add a chart showing the wait time of each queue participant.
- Allow users to call in to the DJ hotline using their browser.
- Add `a "whisper" URL`_ to play instructions to the DJ before her call
  connects.
